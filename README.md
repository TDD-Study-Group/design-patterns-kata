# Design patterns playground

This repository is a playground to experiment on some design patterns. Each package contains independent code which can be refactored using a design pattern (at least).

When you refactor the code, you may find that some examples are also suited for other designs than the one proposed, and you are encouraged to experiment with other designs.
